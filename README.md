🎭 FaceMoodify 
FaceMoodify is an AI-powered web application that turns your selfie into a canvas of emotion. Just take a photo or upload one, and FaceMoodify will detect your facial expression using emotion recognition models like DeepFace or FER. Based on your mood (happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.), it overlays a fun, artistic mask — from a laughing jester to a gloomy clown — bringing your emotion to life visually!

This isn't just for fun — FaceMoodify also logs your “mood masks” over time, helping you track your emotional journey like a journal. Whether you're a mental health enthusiast, an AI tinkerer, or just looking for a cool selfie tool, FaceMoodify brings tech and expression together beautifully.
